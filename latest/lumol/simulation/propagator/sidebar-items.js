Different propagators needs different ways to compute the temperature: Monte-Carlo temperature is a constant of the simulation, whereas for molecular dynamics we use the instantaneous velocities."]],"trait":[["Propagator","The propagator trait is the main algorithm of a simulation, i.e. the one which update the system. The main function here is `propagate`, which should propagate the simulation for one step."]]});
